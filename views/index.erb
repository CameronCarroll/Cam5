		<h2> Academic Interests: </h2>
		<p>
			After spending a few years pursuing a CS/IS degree, I'm left with an affinity for computer technology and a dream of being an engineer. I'm currently attending Grossmont & Cuyamaca colleges and hoping to transfer into chemical engineering or engineering physics.
